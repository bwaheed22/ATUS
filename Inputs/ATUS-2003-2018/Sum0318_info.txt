The file atussum_0318.dat (2003-18 Activity Summary file) contains 455 variables and 201,151 observations.

The 2003-18 Activity Summary file contains data for the total number of minutes that each respondent spent doing each 6-digit activity.  
Each record corresponds to a unique respondent, as indicated by a unique value of the variable TUCASEID.  

The variable names identify activities by their 6-digit codes.  The letter "t" precedes the 6-digit codes.  The first and second digits 
of the 6-digit code correspond to the variable trtier1p; the first, second, third and fourth digits of the 6-digit code correspond to the 
variable trtier2p; and, all six digits of the 6-digit code correspond to the variable trcodep.  For example, the variable "t040102" 
refers to the activity with TRTIER1P=04, TRTIER2P=0401, and TRCODEP=040102.  As documented in the ATUS 2003-18 Coding Lexicon 
(https://www.bls.gov/tus/lexiconnoex0318.pdf), activity code "040102" corresponds to "Caring for and helping nonhousehold members/
Caring for and helping nonhousehold children/Reading to or with nonhousehold children." See Chapter 5 of the ATUS User's Guide 
(https://www.bls.gov/tus/atususersguide.pdf) for more information about the ATUS Coding Lexicon. 

In addition to the activity code variables (t010101...t509999), the file atussum_0318.dat includes selected variables (such as age, sex, 
and labor force status of the respondent) from the Respondent and ATUS-CPS files.  The definitions for variables that begin with the letter 
"P" or "G" appear in the 2003-18 ATUS-CPS Data Dictionary, available at https://www.bls.gov/tus/atuscpscodebk0318.pdf; the definitions 
for variables that begin with the letter "T" (other than t010101...t509999) appear in the 2003-18 ATUS Interview Data Dictionary, available at 
https://www.bls.gov/tus/atusintcodebk0318.pdf.
